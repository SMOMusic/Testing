		<h1 class='tCenter'>About</h1>
		<p class='tCenter'>This is Kestrogle. A new search engine developed to combat the rise of Internet tracking.<br><br>So what's special about this search engine? What does it do that no other search engine does?<br><br>When you search with Kestrogle, Kestrogle goes out to the different search engines and retrieves the data you are looking for in your stead. This means the search engines never associate what you searched for with you. They instead associate it with Kestrogle. And, Kestrogle will also be displaying the results from multiple search engines at once, making finding the most relevant data a lot easier and no longer a debate about which engine is the most relevant.</p>
		<h1 class='tCenter'>Privacy</h1>
		<p class='tCenter'>Kestrogle exists as a way of escaping the tracking that name brand search engines have on us. As such, we will never store any data on you, the user, ever. And if we do have need of keeping your query around, we will make sure that you know about it and agree to it beforehand - in plain text, not some Terms of Service or Privacy Policy legalese.</p>
